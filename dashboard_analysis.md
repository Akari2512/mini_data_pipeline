# 📊 Dashboard Insights – Electricity Bill Analysis

This document summarizes key insights extracted from the dashboard visualizations.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 1. Number of People vs. Electricity Bill

- As household size increases, the average electricity bill generally increases.
- However, the increase is not linear — the bill **plateaus or slightly drops** after 9 people.
- This may suggest:
  - Energy usage efficiency in larger households (shared consumption)
  - Possible limitations in appliance access per capita

## 🏠 2. House Size vs. Electricity Bill

- Households with area **over 1000 sqft** have the **highest average bill**.
- Small houses (< 500 sqft) consistently pay less, indicating strong correlation between space and energy needs.
- Suggests energy usage scales with house size, possibly due to cooling/heating demands.

## 🌆 3. Urban vs. Rural Households

- Urban areas have **significantly higher average bills** than rural ones.
- Possible reasons:
  - More appliances in urban homes
  - Greater reliance on AC, TV, or electric cooking
  - Higher income correlating with higher usage

## 👶 4. Number of Children vs. Electricity Bill

The data shows a clear upward trend in electricity bills as the number of children increases. This suggests that:

- Households with more children tend to consume more electricity.
- This could be due to greater usage of electronic devices such as TVs, computers, or gaming consoles for entertainment.
- Lighting may also be used for longer periods in the evening, as children are often more active and require well-lit environments to play, study, or move around safely.

This highlights how household demographics — particularly the presence of children — can significantly influence energy consumption patterns.

## ✅ Summary

These insights show that **energy consumption is influenced by both physical (house size) and demographic (people, children) factors**.

The data pipeline and dashboard not only support technical processing but also reveal valuable business insights.
